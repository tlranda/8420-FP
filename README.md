Spring 2022 under Dr. Kai Liu @ Clemson SC

## First-Time Setup
To set up your environment and download all necessary data, just ONCE, execute `. first_setup.sh`.
The script includes a few outputs to ensure that everything runs as expected.

## Future Setups
Prior to running the scripts, execute `. setup.sh` to ensure your environment is ready to run.
The script repeats validation output to ensure everything is OK.

## Short notes:
[SacreBLEU](https://github.com/mjpost/sacreBLEU) has useful examples in the main README to show how to PROPERLY evaluate scores
